Evaluate the focus distinction of the cat in the photograph. Judge whether the cat appears crisp and defined relative to the rest of the image. A cat that is in sharp focus while its surroundings fall into softness or blur creates a visual hierarchy that draws the eye directly to it. A cat that is equally sharp as — or softer than — the objects around it flattens that hierarchy and becomes just another element in the scene. Also consider whether the cat's own features — its eyes, fur texture, the edges of its ears and body — are rendered with enough internal clarity that the viewer can immediately recognize the subject as a cat, rather than perceiving only motion, color, or an indistinct shape. This task is not about measuring absolute technical sharpness or pixel-level resolution. It is about whether the focus of the photograph serves the cat by guiding the viewer's eye toward it and away from everything else. Score high when the cat is the sharpest element in the image and its features are clearly defined. Score low when the cat is out of focus, motion-blurred, or no sharper than its surroundings.
