1. Evaluate the focal separation between the cat and its surroundings. Examine whether the cat is rendered more sharply than the environment around it — the background, the foreground, and any nearby objects. Determine whether a meaningful difference in sharpness exists that creates a visual hierarchy, drawing the eye toward the cat and away from the rest of the scene. A cat in crisp focus against a softened background demonstrates strong focal separation. A cat that shares equal sharpness with every element around it, or worse, appears softer than its surroundings, demonstrates weak or failed focal separation. This is not a demand for shallow depth of field, but an assessment of whether focus, however subtly, prioritizes the cat over everything else in the frame.

2. Evaluate the feature definition of the cat itself. Examine whether the cat's own physical features are rendered with enough clarity to be immediately perceived and appreciated. The eyes are the primary anchor — sharp, legible eyes give a cat undeniable presence. Beyond the eyes, assess whether the texture of the fur, the edges of the ears, the outline of the whiskers, and the contour of the body are resolved with sufficient detail. Consider whether motion blur, distance, or insufficient resolution has robbed the cat of its internal definition, reducing it from a recognizable portrait to an indistinct shape. This task distinguishes between a cat that is merely located within the focal plane and a cat whose form is truly rendered with clarity.

3. Evaluate the visual authority of the cat within the photograph as a whole. Examine whether the combined effect of focus across the entire image grants the cat command over the scene, making it the undeniable subject. Consider whether the cat's presence is diluted by competing elements that share its plane of sharpness — other animals, human faces, or prominent objects that draw the eye away. Consider whether the cat occupies enough of the frame, with enough focal emphasis, to assert itself as the reason the photograph exists. This is the holistic judgment: does a viewer look at this photograph and immediately understand that it is a picture of a cat, not a picture of a scene that happens to contain one.
